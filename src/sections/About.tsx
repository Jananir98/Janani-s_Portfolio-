I am a Frontend Developer with 3+ years of professional experience at Inforios Private Limited, specializing in building scalable and maintainable React applications. I focus on performance optimization, SEO best practices, and clean, responsive UI development.

I have hands-on experience with JavaScript, TypeScript, and modern frontend architectures, along with cloud deployment using AWS. I actively use AI-assisted development tools such as Claude and Cursor to improve development efficiency, code quality, and problem-solving.

I have worked on real-world applications involving secure payment integrations, role-based access systems, and production-grade UI components. I enjoy building user-focused products and continuously improving application performance and developer workflows.      </p>
